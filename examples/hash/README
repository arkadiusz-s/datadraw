This is a simple hashed tabled based database application designed to test hash keys other than by name.

To use it type:

    $ ./configure
    $ ./make

To execute it, just type:

    $ ./hash nodes.txt

It should simply read nodes.txt and complain when it sees a second node at the same x and y position as a previous
one.
