
- get latest cygwin (I'm using Flex 2.5.4 and Bison 2.3 and
  have tested building with vs6 and vs2005-express-edition;
  I've got MANY warnings regarding 64bit-support, don't know
  if that is problematic or not)
  
- include the path from bison and flex into visual studio 
  executable directory (be sure that really the new tools
  are used and no other bison/flex is before yours in the
  path!)  Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Executables
  
- hit compile, in the datadraw-executable is the "undo and
  persistence"-library included by default and in the 
  project-setting exceptions are disabled.
  
have fun

PS: I've not tested the windows-version much, but it
    generates the graph-example so I think it's working.

- Get the latest CMake version from
  http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

- Run the CMake interface against the datadraw directory.

- You should end up with the project files for your choosen
  compiler in the datadraw directory.

have fun

PS: If you find any issues, please patch them if possible, but
    above all, please report them to the SF project tracker!
