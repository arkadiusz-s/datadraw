Since multiple developers are joining the DataDraw development team, some words about coding style are in order.

The code format that exists in the current files should be followed closely, so that the code looks consistent.  Note
that there are no '*' '->' or '.' operators used in the manually generated code, except for 'char *' variables.  Also,
there are no pointers to pointers (char **).  Further, there are no '#if'.  The except to these rules are low-level
files in the util directory.  As much as possible '#if' declarations should be confined to uttypes.h, and they should
not show up outside the util directory (except in generated database files).  Every function should have a comment.
Functions should be small, typically fitting on a single page in VI (25 lines or less).

Tabs are to be removed from the source before checking in (I use the 'expand' utility).  This keeps us from fighting
over whether they are 4 or 8 spaces.  The "^M" characters that appear at the ends of lines when DOS editors are used
should be removed.  I use the "dos2unix" utility for this.

Recently, #defines have been replaced by 'static inline' functions as there is no performance cost and are more
compiler and debugger friendly.

That's it for now!  Feel free to enhance this file as issues arise.
